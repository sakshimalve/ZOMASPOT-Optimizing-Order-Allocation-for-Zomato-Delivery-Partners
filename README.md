# ZOMASPOT – Optimizing Order Allocation for Zomato Delivery Partners

**ZOMASPOT** is an intelligent, real-time system designed to optimize food delivery logistics by predicting demand hotspots and allocating delivery orders efficiently. The project integrates **Machine Learning**, **real-time APIs**, and a **mobile-friendly interface** to help platforms like Zomato improve delivery speed, reduce idle time for delivery partners, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## 🚀 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to streamline the delivery process by:

- Predicting **demand hotspots** based on real-time location and time data.
- Allocating delivery orders to the **most suitable delivery partner** using machine learning.
- Minimizing delivery delays and balancing workload across partners.
- Providing a **mobile interface** for delivery partners to navigate easily.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Food delivery platforms often face challenges in managing large volumes of orders in peak hours, especially in high-demand areas. Delivery partners may end up getting assigned inefficient routes or idle in low-demand zones. ZOMASPOT solves this by:

- Forecasting order volume using ML models.
- Allocating deliveries based on partner proximity and availability.
- Suggesting optimal zones for delivery partners to position themselves.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest Regressor (for demand prediction)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Frontend**: Flutter (Android app for delivery partners)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **APIs Used**: Google Maps API, Zomato API (for location and order data)

## 📱 Features

- 📍 Real-time map-based interface for delivery partners.
- 🔁 Smart order allocation based on availability and proximity.
- 📊 Admin panel to view demand heatmaps and system performance.
- 🔮 Demand forecasting using ML based on historical data.
- 🧭 Directions and optimal route suggestions via Google Maps API.

## 🧩 Workflow

1. Collect historical order data (location, time, order count).
2. Train a machine learning model to forecast demand per region and time.
3. Use real-time APIs to fetch current delivery locations and partner status.
4. Allocate new orders based on ML predictions and real-time availability.
5. Visualize hotspots and traffic zones for better dispatching.


## 🎯 Future Scope

- Expand to multiple delivery platforms.
- Integrate weather and traffic data for more accurate predictions.
- Gamify delivery partner performance insights.
- Add predictive delivery time estimation for users.
